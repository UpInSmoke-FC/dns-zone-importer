## Introduction

This document explains how to contribute changes to [UpInSmoke-FC/dns-zone-importer](https://github.com/UpInSmoke-FC/dns-zone-importer).

> Sensitive security-related issues should be reported to
[security@upinsmoke.systems](mailto:security@upinsmoke.systems).

## Bug reports

Please search the issues on the issue tracker with a variety of keywords
to ensure your bug is not already reported.

If unique, [open an issue](https://github.com/UpInSmoke-FC/dns-zone-importer/issues/new).

Please write clear, concise instructions so we can reproduce the behavior—
even if it seems obvious. The more detailed and specific you are,
the faster we can fix the issue. Check out [How to Report Bugs
Effectively]


## Discuss your design

The project welcomes submissions. If you want to change or add something,
please let everyone know what you're working on—[file an issue](https://github.com/UpInSmoke-FC/dns-zone-importer/issues/new)!
Significant changes must go through the change proposal process
before they can be accepted. To create a proposal, file an issue with
your proposed changes documented, and make sure to add the label "proposal".

This process gives everyone a chance to validate the design, helps
prevent duplication of effort, and ensures that the idea fits inside
the goals for the project and tools. It also checks that the design is
sound before code is written; the code review tool is not the place for
high-level discussions.

## Testing your changes
> *Coming Soon...*

## Verification Process

Changes to [UpInSmoke-FC/dns-zone-importer](https://github.com/UpInSmoke-FC/dns-zone-importer) must be reviewed before they are accepted—unless they are an owner or a maintainer. We use GitHub's
pull request & review workflow to do that. GitHub ensures every PR is reviewed by at least 1 maintainer.

Please try to make your pull request easy to review for us.

* Make small pull requests. The smaller, the faster to review and the
  more likely it will be merged soon.
* Don't make changes unrelated to your PR. Maybe there are typos on
  some comments, maybe refactoring would be welcome on a function... but
  if that is not related to your PR, please make *another* PR for that.
* Split big pull requests into multiple small ones. An incremental change
  will be faster to review than a huge PR.
